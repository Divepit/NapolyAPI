# Empty Sandbox Backend

I'm using this project to have an empty sandbox version of a Ruby on Rails backend for a vue/rails api project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

run
```
bundle install
```
and
```
rails db:migrate
```

and then check for TODO items in the project. They indicate where changes need to be done to customize the app in a new project.
